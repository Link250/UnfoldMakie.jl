		&& in comments

DONE - Default :channel to be categorical
	half-categorical if needed



DONE - Butterfly plots new color scale

FIX Legend/Colorbar
	colorbar! and legend! functions are very strict with their input
	we split both configs and made "position" an extra value
	SOME PROBLEM with nonnumeric, color=... is directly in mapping for now


Mapping.color is only the collumn
	We need to give the actual colors. Maybe we have to create our own mapping
	eig überall colorArray and pallets
	New idea with custom mapping



Topolots should be officially released on 4.7
	Topolots as coloscale/Colorlegend
