# [ERP Image Visualization](@id erpi_vis)

Here we discuss butterfly plot visualization. 
Make sure you have looked into the [installation instructions](@ref install_instruct).

## Include used Modules
The following modules are necessary for following this tutorial:
```
using Unfold
using UnfoldMakie
using StatsModels # can be removed in Unfold v0.3.5
using CairoMakie
```

## Data
In case you do not already have data, look at the [Load Data](@ref test_data) section. 

Use the test data of `erpcore-N170.jld2`.
Note that you do not need the pre-processing step detailed in that section.

## Plot ERP Images

The following code will result in the default configuration. 
```
cErp = PlotConfig(:erp)
```
At this point you can detail changes you want to make to the visualization through the plot config. These are detailed further below. 

This is how you plot the ERP image.
```
cErp.plot(dat_e[28,:,:])
```

## Column Mappings for ERP Images

Since erp images use a `Matrix` as an input, the library does not need any infos about the mapping.

## Configurations for ERP Images

Here we look into possible options for configuring the ERP image visualization using `config.setExtraValues(<name>=<value>,...)`.
By calling the `config.plot(...)` function on an ERP image the function `plot_erp(...)` is executed.
For more general options look into the `Plot Configuration` section of the documentation.
This is the list of unique configuration (extraData):
- erpBlur (number)
- sortData (boolean)
- meanPlot (boolean)


### erpBlur (number)
Is a number indicating how much blur is applied to the image; using Gaussian blur of the ImageFiltering module. 
Default value is `10`. Negative values deactivate the blur.

### sortData (boolean)
Indicating whether the data is sorted; using sortperm() of Base Julia 
(sortperm() computes a permutation of the array's indices that puts the array into sorted order). 
Default is `false`.

### meanPlot (boolean)
Indicating whether the plot should add a line plot below the ERP image, showing the mean of the data.
Default is `false`.


```
cErp = PlotConfig(:erp)

cErp.setExtraValues(meanPlot = true)
cErp.setColorbarValues(label = "Voltage [ÂµV]")
cErp.setVisualValues(colormap = Reverse("RdBu"), colorrange = (-40, 40))

cErp.plot(dat_e[28,:,:])
```
