## [Extra Data](@id config_extra)

The extra data of the configuration consists of all config options that are unique for the visualizations. 

The following extra data options exist:

### categoricalColor (boolean)
Used for `Line Plot`, indicates whether it should be categorized based on color. 
Every line will get its discrete entry in the legend.
Default is `true`.

### categoricalGroup (boolean) TODO? (plot_line.jl)
Used for `Line Plot`, indicates whether it should be categorized based on group.
The legend is a colorbar.
Default is `true`.

### erpBlur (number)
Used for `ERP Image`, is a number indicating how much blur is applied to the image; using Gaussian blur of the ImageFiltering module. Default value is `10`. Negative values are snapped to `0`.

### legendLabel
Used for

### meanPlot (boolean)
Used for `ERP Image`, indicating whether the plot should be a line plot using the mean of the data. 
Default is `false`.

### pvalue (array) TODO? (plot_line.jl)
Used for `Line Plot`, is an array of p-values. If array not empty, complement data by adding p-values.
Default is an empty array.

### sortData (boolean)
Used for `Designmatrix`, indicating whether the data is sorted; using sortslices() of Base Julia. 
Default is `false`.

Used for `ERP Image`, indicating whether the data is sorted; using sortperm() of Base Julia 
(sortperm() computes a permutation of the array's indices that puts the array into sorted order). 
Default is `false`.

### standardizeData (boolean)
Used for `Designmatrix`, indicating whether the data is standardized by pointwise division of the data with its sampled standard deviation. 
Default is `true`.

### stderror (boolean)
Used for `Line Plot`, indicating whether the data estimates should be complemented 
with lower and higher estimates based on the stderror. 
Lower estimates is gained by pointwise subtraction of the stderror from the estimates. 
Higher estimates is gained by pointwise addition of the stderror to the estimates. 
Both estimates are then included in the mapping. 
Default is `false`.

### topoLabel
Used for

### topoLegend (boolean)
Used for `Line Plot`, indicating whether a topo plot is used as a legend.
Default is `false`.

### topoPositions
Used for

### xTicks (number)
Used for `Designmatrix`, indicating the number of labels on the x-axis. Behavior if specified in configuration:
- xTicks = 0: no labels are placed.
- xTicks = 1: first possible label is placed.
- xTicks = 2: first and last possible labels are placed.
- 2 < xTicks < number of labels: xTicks-2 labels are placed between the first and last.
- xTicks â‰¥ number of labels: all labels are placed.
