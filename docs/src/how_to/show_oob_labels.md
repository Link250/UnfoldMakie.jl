## [Show out of Bounds Label](@id ht_soobl)

When visualizing a designmatrix it can happen that the labels on the y-axis get cut off towards the left (especially if they are quite long). 
In the following we discuss a possible quick fix for this problem.

Here we start off with the "label-limited" timeexpanded designmatrix from the [corresponding How To section](@ref ht_gen_te_designmatrix) that details how it can be generated.
