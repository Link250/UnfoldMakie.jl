## [General ERP Image Visualization](@id erpi_vis)

Here we discuss general butterfly plot visualization. 
Make sure you have looked into the [installation instructions](@ref install_instruct).

### Include used Modules
The following modules are necessary:
```@example main
using Unfold
using UnfoldMakie
using StatsModels # can be removed in Unfold v0.3.5
using DataFrames
using CairoMakie
using DataFramesMeta
using Random
```
Note that `DataFramesMeta` is also used here in order to be able to use `@subset` for testing (filtering).

Note that `Random` is used.

### Data
In case you do not already have data, look at the [Load Data](@ref test_data) section. 

Use the test data of `erpcore-N170.jld2`.
Note that you do not need the pre-processing step detailed in that section.

### Configurations for ERP Images
Here you can see a standard configuration.
```@example main
erpConfig = PlotConfig(:erp)
erpConfig.setExtraValues(;ylims = (low = 3650, high = 8000),
	ylabel = "Sorted trials",
	meanPlot = true)
erpConfig.setColorbarValues(;label = "Voltage [ÂµV]")
erpConfig.setVisualValues(;colormap = Reverse("RdBu"), colorrange = (-40, 40))
```

### Plot ERP Images
This is how you finally plot the ERP image.

```@example main
plot_erp(dat_e[28,:,:], erpConfig)
```

## TODO: MORE CONFIG DETAILS ONCE FINISHED
- is DataFramesMeta needed here?
- Link to confii + more detail?
